<div style="padding-left: 30px;">

My name is Mateusz Szymoński.  
I work as a **Junior Technical Artist at CD PROJEKT RED**.

I am an enthusiast of Computer Science, especially fields related to game development: **Technical Art, Computer Graphics and Engine Programming**.  
Moreover, I am a self-thought **3D Artist** specializing in prop modeling and environment art.

I have graduated from Warsaw University of Technology with a **Bachelor's degree in Computer Science**, with the highest degree for my thesis: *"Design and Implementation of a Computer Game Engine"*.

Not secretly, I am a huge fan of game jams and Rust programming language.

### Agent-based modelling of car platooning for traffic optimization
{{< image src="/media/images/platooning.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

`Unity` `C#` 

A scientific research paper which I was co-author of, published in 2021 4th International Symposium on Agents, Multi-Agent Systems and Robotics (ISAMSR)

Addressing the topic of gasoline consumption reduction thanks to the implementation of a platooning system for autonomous vehicles moving on the highways.

For the purpose of this study, a state machine system of distributed agents was created to simulate the communication and cooperation of the vehicles and to calculate the air resistance factor reduction.

### Temple of Ylnir
{{< image src="/media/images/temple_of_ylnir.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

`Unity` `Blender` `Substance Painter` `Substance Designer` `Photoshop`

Realtime 3D environment project made in Unity Engine for [Inside The Vault](https://blog.unity.com/games/the-winners-inside-the-vault-3d-environment-art-contest) contest.
Third place winning project.

The project is a short cinematic consisting of two scenes in which a small drone exploring a forgotten temple is the main actor. All models and textures were created by hand for this work specifically. The project uses HDRP rendering pipeline. All actions are animated using a timeline and blend shapes. Additionally, a small manager tool allowing for controlling the demo playback was created.

# Other Activity
<div style="padding-left: 30px;">

### KNTG Polygon
{{< image src="/media/images/polygon.png" position="center" style="border-radius: 8px;" >}}

I was vice president of [KNTG "Polygon"](https://kntgpolygon.pl/) – a student association of game developers at Warsaw University of Technology.  
I met there many amazing people who pushed me further into game dev and enthused me with game jams.  
Before and during my presidency, I was organizing and conducting weekly meetings, managing social media, and handling necessary administrative tasks.  
My main goal was to popularize game creation among young people.
